# What is this?
This is my personal experience of suffering with WebSockets. It's not done yet, because I'm ~~busy with enrolling into univercity~~ lazy. 

## What this project is supposed to accomplished?
This is supposed to be a carbon-copy of this [project](https://github.com/ably-labs/websockets-cursor-sharing), but ~~with a lot of boilerplate~~ mine should use Svelte for frontend. 

### What can I do with this project?
Feel free to look through if you want to, maybe fork the thing and finish the project to make me jelous and finally pick it up.
